## Pull Requests

This page contains a running list of pull requests I've made for the project, as well as a quick write-up for each.

### 2-July 2022 [Finish the map support](https://github.com/OpenMS/autowrap/pull/160)
This PR finishes the work needed for allowing wrapped classes as both keys and values in C++ map data structures.
Additionally, the pull-request includes a significant refactor to the `StdMapConverter` class's `output_conversion` method which builds the Cython text used to instantiate and return a `Code` object. This refactor will hopefully lay the foundation for further refactors of the `ConversionProvider`. Simplifying this script should make the learning curve for contribution just a little less steep.
