# Erik's availability

To keep the maintainers apprised of my availability this summer, I want to make the following notes:

* First of all, I'm in the central standard timezone. This means that 1500 in Berlin is 0800 for me.
* I work full time and my job is my priority. I mentioned this in my project proposal. That said, I don't work more than 40 hours a week so it's not an exhausting job.
* June 7 - June 9 I will be attending and speaking at a conference. This just means I won't be as available during the day, I'll still be workig on the project at night.
* The weekend of June 17th I will not be around.
* June 29 - July 1st I'll be moving across the country so I'll definitely be out of pocket those days.
* August 1st - 14th I'll be in the middle east so I'll be in a different time zone. Still planning to work on the project during this time.
* Last week of August is when I start school so my pace will slow down but hopefully by then I'll be pretty close to done.
