# Erik's GSoC 2022 Contributor Page

For the Google Summer of Code 2022 event, I'll be working with an Open Bioinformatics Foundation (OBF) subgroup called OpenMS. Specifically, I'll be working on the Autowrap project, a tool for making C++ libraries available in Python. This site will be where I keep track of updates and stuff I learn.
